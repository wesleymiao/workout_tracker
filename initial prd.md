a web-based personal workout tracker

mostly used on my iphone browser.

before the workout, I can start a workout, it will first remind me a checklist on things to bring. The checklist can be configured.

I can choose workout type based on a pre-configured list of types: 1: Pull, 2: Push 3: Legs 4: Swim 5: Run (Gym) 6: Run (Outdoor)

For 1: Pull, 2: Push, 3: Legs, I can set targets on what I will do for that workout in terms of equipment type, selected weight and targed reps and sets, for example, Chest press machine, 15 reps at 100kg for 3 sets. Please pull in my previous exercise of same type as pre-populated targets if it can find my previous exercise record of same type. I can still edit them.

after each exercise, I can click "finish" and it will give me a summary of my workout details.

The tracker can also give me statistics of my past workout, as a motivator for persistence. It can also remind me if I obviously trend to workout less or stop or give up.
